# MAGD-150-Portfolio

Here is the 3rd assignment I completed for MAGD 150. The assignment was to create a screensaver. In my sketch I made a ball bounce around the screen with a few other shapes that reacted to the mouses movement.

Here is the 5th assignment I completed for MAGD 150. The assignment was to swtich between three different "universes", I did this by clicking different buttons on the sketch which makes certain colors change on the sketch.

Here is the 7th assignment I completed for MAGD 150. In the sketch I used an array to create multiple images on the screen and then had them move around the screen and go through transformations according to the mouses location.

Here is the 10th assignment I completed for MAGD 150. In this sketch I drew two 3D spheres and textured them to look like planets and I used lights to give the shapes more depth.
